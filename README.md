# EarthlyConsensus System

In this repository is the EarthlyConsensus developed in the context of the thesis to obtain the masters degree in  Computer Science and Engineering, for Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico.

## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Hyperledger Fabric
* Ollama's Llama3
* Golang
* Ruby
* Npm
* Python3
* Django

### Installing

* A blockchain network is required to be started on a server with access to all parts of the project.
* The smart-contract chaincode (in [chaincode-go-remade](https://github.com/g2pinto/tese/tree/master/chaincode/chaincode-go-remade)) needs to be installed in the blockchain network.

### Executing program

* First it is necessary to start the blockchain network using couchDb. On this project the test-network was used, for which the command is simply:
```
$ .\network.sh up -s couchdb
```
* Next, Loomio server needs to be started, for that:
```
$ cd looomio
$ rails s
```
And in another terminal
```
$ cd loomio/vue
$ npm run serve
```
* After this, you are ready to start the chainserver (EcoMonitor).
```
$ cd chainserver
$ python3 manage.py runserver
```
